# AMS Protocol FAQ
### What all AMS practices are enabled in your system?
Currently the system enables the following initiatives
- Compliance to infection treatment guidelines
- Classification of antibiotics based on WHO Aware criteria
- Restricting usage of certain drugs for certain infection sites
- Optimising the usage of narrow spectrum drugs
- Reducing the usage of redundant antibiotic combinations
- Reducing the usage of high end antibiotics
- Recommending IV to oral switch
- Recommending dicontinuation of antibiotics
- Reducing over prescription of antibiotics
Additional initiatives can be built upon a case to case basis

### Is it possible to get more analytics than currently shown by the system?
We keep on building new analytics into the platform as a part of our product improvement process. These advanced analytics however depend on the availability and quality of data.

### Are all prescription deviations counted towards compliance?
The system enables two levels of checks for incompliant prescriptions. The first level is an automated check based on the rules defined by the AMS team in the platform. The second level is manual check by the AMS team members. Only those prescriptions which are flagged by the automated system as well as not approved manually by the AMS team are counted as incompliant

### Is it possible to add more AMS protocols than currently incorporated in the system?
We keep on building new protocols into the platform as a part of our product improvement process. These new protocols will however depend on the availability of data required to analyse and implement these protocols.

### Where does ZEVAC derive the antibiotic prescription data from?
Prescription data is ideally derived from digital prescriptions in EMR systems. In the absence of digital prescriptions we can pull data from pharmacy indents with limitation on the quality of data and subsequent analytics that can be provided.

### Is the prescription data available real-time?
Live prescription data can be provided through EMR integration.

### Will the users get any alerts and how?
The system has the ability to deliver alerts through email/sms. The events for which the alerts can be sent can be customised for the hospital. The user also has the ability to turn on or off these alerts.

### My hospital does not have an EHR , how can we still calculate DOT / DDD?
In the absence of digital prescriptions it is not possible to get accurate analysis for DOT/DDD.

### Who all will be notified by the alerts: AMS or Clinicians or both?
The system can generate allerts for both clinicians as well as the AMS team.

### My hospital does not have an EHR, can Zevac still do prescription audit?
Prescription data is ideally derived from digital prescriptions in EMR systems. In the absence of digital prescriptions we can pull data from pharmacy indents with limitation on the quality of data and subsequent analytics that can be provided.

### Will updates in the AMS protocols be notified to clinicians?
Any change in guidelines is communicated to the physicians in the notifications module. Each notification must be 'marked as read' by the user before it disappears.

### Can the interventions suggested by the AMS team be audited?
The system maintains a log of the suggested interventions which can then be audited. A break up of suggested interventions is also available on the dashboard.

### How does de-escalation of the antibiotics work in Zevac?
The system can be programmed to send notifications for switching from IV to oral drugs to the prescribing drugs.
Also, cases where a high-level drug has been prescribed empirically and a lower-level drug is found to be sensitive on culture results, are flagged to the AMS team for review.

### How does Zevac ensure discontinuation - both in EHR and non-EHR hospitals?
The system can be programmed to send notifications for discontinuation to the prescribing clinician based on the duration provided by the AMS team.
